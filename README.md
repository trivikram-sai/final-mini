#Documentation
The first step while creating this project was to finalize a design and components of our project. To do this we used internet which helped us a lot in finalizing our design.
Next, we created the home page of our website which included a brief idea about what our bakery is about. We also used google sheets API to collect the responses for our contact form.
Next, we created the sign up and login page which is essential to do before placing orders. We linked this with our home.
Next, we went on to design our product page. We made the cart section and checkout section. This was the most challenging part in our project and we took help of the internet to finish this. We learnt about different features of JS to achieve this.
Next, we integrated our product page and home page and made sure that people who are not signed in cannot place orders.
Next, we tested our website to find any potential bugs/errors which can affect the user experience

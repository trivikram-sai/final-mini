# Bakery Website Project

Welcome to our bakery website project! This README provides an overview of the development process and key steps involved in creating our website.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a functional bakery website where users can explore our products, place orders, and contact us for inquiries. We utilized various technologies and resources to bring our vision to life.

## Development Process

1. **Design Finalization**: Finalized the design and components of the project by extensively researching and gathering ideas from internet resources.

2. **Homepage Creation**: Developed the homepage, introducing our bakery and its concept. We integrated a contact form using the Google Sheets API to collect inquiries.

3. **Sign Up and Login Page Development**: Created essential authentication pages for users to sign up and log in before placing orders. These pages were linked with the homepage for seamless navigation.

4. **Product Page Design**: Designed a product page featuring a cart and checkout section. This was the most challenging part of our project, and we utilized internet resources to overcome obstacles and implement desired functionalities using JavaScript.

5. **Integration and User Authentication**: Integrated the product page with the homepage and implemented user authentication to restrict ordering access to signed-in users.

6. **Testing**: Conducted thorough testing to identify and rectify potential bugs and errors that could impact user experience. Our goal was to ensure the website's functionality and usability.
